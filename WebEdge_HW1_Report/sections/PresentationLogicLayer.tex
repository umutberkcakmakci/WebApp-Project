\subsection{Home Page}

The home page is the main page of our website. In this page, we have some movie suggestions for 2 categories; best of all and top picks for this week. We choose best of all movies based on overall ratings and display the first 6 of them in our home page. For top picks, admins choose randomly (or last week's most watched first 6 movies) and they are also displayed in home page.
